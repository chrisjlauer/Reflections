If something worked before and it doesn't now you can figure out what broke.

Manual is better that automatic saving because it is difficult to determine a rule for when a substantive change has been made.

treating each file seperately is easier, but sometimes changes to multiple files are required.

git log lets you view al versions, git diff lets you compare two versions

You will be able to find what you broke
